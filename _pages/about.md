I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [School of EIEE](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests include multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, and large language models.



I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am currently on an inter at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/).

I obtained my bachelor’s degree (honors) in computer science from the [ACM class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [School of EIEE](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisor is [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I'm also very fortunate to have an internship at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/).
